Bio::DB::USeq Change Log

0.24    * Implemented Interval Trees for much faster lookup of slices and 
          observations when collecting data. The side effect is that observations 
          may not be returned in the original genomic order. This will not affect 
          statistical summaries and wiggle features.
        * Added new low level method (observations) for directly retrieving 
          observations without having to wrap the observations into SeqFeature 
          objects as with the features() method.
        * Fixed bug where statistical summaries would not count observations with 
          a score of 0. 

0.23    * Include script, USeqInfo.pl, for quick information about useq files.
        * Bug fixes to avoid division by zero errors.
        * Bug fix to parse sequence names with periods.
        * Documentation improvements.
        * Update license.

0.22    * Added missing POD documentation

0.21    * Set requirement for Perl 5.10.0. Will not compile on lower versions.
        * Fixed some POD formatting.

0.20    * Added support for text strings (name field) in USeq files.
        * Some documentation changes.

0.19    * Additional minor fixes
        * Added more complete documentation

0.18    * Improved support for GBrowse feature dumping by adding get_seq_stream 
        methods to wiggle and summary objects

0.17    * Added chromosome and global statistical methods to all objects
        * Added support for autoscale methods in wiggle_* glyphs

0.16    * Added support for statistical_summary feature type
        * Added support for the wiggle_whiskers glyph

0.15    * Added support for wiggle feature type by adding array of scores to 
        SeqFeature coverage attribute
        * Increased GBrowse support through wiggle_xyplot glyph and wiggle features
        * Flesh out documentation

0.12    * Collect scores from useq files
        * Very primitive support for GBrowse using xyplot glyph

0.1     * Initial development
        * Open and parse useq archive member names
        * Parse and load binary members

0.0     * Conception!
